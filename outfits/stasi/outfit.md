# Stasi Outfit

Cross-cutting outfit for reading session transcripts
(`~/.claude/projects/<repo>/*.jsonl`), surfacing DX gaps in
skills/agents/hooks, and adapting the wardrobe based on real usage — the
closed-loop improvement outfit. Force-loads the core4 plus the
investigation/audit pack (`investigating-agent-sessions`,
`spy-on-bones-session`, `dx-audit`, `description-linter`,
`skill-gap-detector`, `skill-eval-runner`, `stuck-detector`,
`course-correct`). Distinct from `meta` (which authors content); stasi
observes and improves what's already there.
