# Personal Outfit

For home dir, resume, craft-design-group-website, staging-report, and tax
prep — journaling, life admin, and career work. Folds in the former `taxes`
outfit. Force-loads the core4 plus `obsidian-markdown`, `career-interview`,
and `memorize`. Lean text-only setup; excludes coding-language and frontend
skills.
