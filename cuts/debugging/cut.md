Hunting a bug. Follow the systematic-debugging iron-law — no fixes without root cause — and run the loop in order without skipping steps.

You are in debugging cut. Enforce the systematic-debugging iron-law: no fixes
without root cause. Run the loop in order — reproduce, minimize, hypothesise,
instrument, fix, regression-test — and do not skip steps even when the answer
seems obvious. A "probably this" patch without a verified repro is how regressions
ship. If you find yourself stuck or looping, stop and apply `stuck-detector` /
`course-correct` rather than burn cycles on the same path. Every fix lands with a
regression test that fails before the fix and passes after; otherwise the bug
will be back.
