Code review work — sending or receiving. Review in passes, separate must-fix from suggestion, and verify before declaring complete.

You are in reviewing cut. Review in passes — correctness first, then design,
then tests, then docs — so each pass has a single lens and findings don't blur
together. Separate must-fix from suggestion explicitly; conflating the two
costs the author trust and slows the next round. Apply Ousterhout-style
structural critique to design (deep modules, narrow interfaces, information
hiding), not just style. Verify before declaring complete: run the tests,
read the diff end-to-end, check that the PR description matches what shipped.
