## mattpocock/skills

- **Source:** https://github.com/mattpocock/skills
- **License:** MIT
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2026 Matt Pocock
- **Vendored skills (with `pocock-` prefix):**
  - `pocock-caveman` — from `skills/productivity/caveman/SKILL.md`
  - `pocock-handoff` — from `skills/productivity/handoff/SKILL.md`
  - `pocock-diagnose` — from `skills/engineering/diagnose/SKILL.md` (plus `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh`)
  - `pocock-git-guardrails` — from `skills/misc/git-guardrails-claude-code/SKILL.md` (plus `scripts/block-dangerous-git.sh`)
  - `pocock-setup-pre-commit` — from `skills/misc/setup-pre-commit/SKILL.md`

Adaptations applied: rewrote frontmatter to the wardrobe schema (added `version`, `targets`, `type`, `category`; rewrote `description` into "Use when..." triggering form), renamed the skills with the `pocock-` prefix, and lightly neutralised first-person / personal-directory references. Body content is otherwise as-published upstream.

## obra/superpowers

- **Source:** https://github.com/obra/superpowers
- **License:** MIT
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2025 Jesse Vincent
- **Vendored skills (refreshed 2026-05-14):**
  - `brainstorming/` — refreshed body from upstream
  - `dispatching-parallel-agents/` — refreshed body from upstream
  - `executing-plans/` — refreshed body from upstream
  - `receiving-code-review/` — refreshed body from upstream
  - `requesting-code-review/` — refreshed body from upstream
  - `subagent-driven-development/` — refreshed body from upstream
  - `systematic-debugging/` — refreshed body from upstream
  - `test-driven-development/` — refreshed body from upstream
  - `using-superpowers/` — new (vendored from upstream)
  - `verification-before-completion/` — refreshed body from upstream
  - `writing-plans/` — refreshed body from upstream
  - `writing-skills/` — new (vendored from upstream)

Adaptations applied: preserved wardrobe-schema YAML frontmatter (name, version, targets, type, category) on refreshed skills; bumped version 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 to mark the refresh. Two new skills (`using-superpowers`, `writing-skills`) were authored with the wardrobe schema. Performed a no-git scrub — replaced version-control-tool-specific terminology (worktrees, commits, PRs, push, branch, merge, rebase) with tool-agnostic equivalents (isolated work area, checkpoint, request review, publish, integrate) so skills work in harnesses without git. Two upstream skills (`using-git-worktrees`, `finishing-a-development-branch`) were intentionally dropped. Did NOT vendor the upstream skills' supporting files (templates, reference markdown, code samples) — only the SKILL.md bodies were refreshed.

## rtk-ai/rtk

- **Source:** https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk
- **License:** Apache License 2.0
- **Upstream commit:** `3ba1634` (`dev-0.40.1-rc.222`)
- **Vendored components:**

  **Skills (under `skills/`, all prefixed with `rtk-`):**
  - `rtk-triage/SKILL.md` — from `.claude/skills/rtk-triage/SKILL.md`
  - `rtk-tdd/SKILL.md` — from `.claude/skills/rtk-tdd/SKILL.md`
  - `rtk-tdd-rust/SKILL.md` and `rtk-tdd-rust/references/testing-patterns.md` — from `.claude/skills/tdd-rust/`
  - `rtk-issue-triage/SKILL.md` and `rtk-issue-triage/templates/issue-comment.md` — from `.claude/skills/issue-triage/`
  - `rtk-pr-triage/SKILL.md` and `rtk-pr-triage/templates/review-comment.md` — from `.claude/skills/pr-triage/`
  - `rtk-pr-review/SKILL.md` — from `.claude/skills/pr-review/SKILL.md`
  - `rtk-security-guardian/SKILL.md` — from `.claude/skills/security-guardian/SKILL.md`
  - `rtk-code-simplifier/SKILL.md` — from `.claude/skills/code-simplifier/SKILL.md`
  - `rtk-design-patterns/SKILL.md` — from `.claude/skills/design-patterns/SKILL.md`
  - `rtk-performance/SKILL.md` — from `.claude/skills/performance/SKILL.md`
  - `rtk-ship/SKILL.md` — from `.claude/skills/ship/SKILL.md`
  - `rtk-repo-recap/SKILL.md` — from `.claude/skills/repo-recap/SKILL.md`

  **Agents (under `agents/`):**
  - `rtk-testing-specialist/AGENT.md` — from `.claude/agents/rtk-testing-specialist.md`
  - `rtk-rust-expert/AGENT.md` — from `.claude/agents/rust-rtk.md` (upstream name `rust-rtk` renamed to `rtk-rust-expert` for prefix consistency)

  **Hooks (under `hooks/`):**
  - `rtk-suggest/` (HOOK.md + `hooks/rtk-suggest.sh`) — from `.claude/hooks/rtk-suggest.sh`
  - `rtk-rewrite/` (HOOK.md + `hooks/rtk-rewrite.sh`) — from `.claude/hooks/rtk-rewrite.sh`
  - `rtk-pre-commit-format/` (HOOK.md + `hooks/rtk-pre-commit-format.sh`) — from `.claude/hooks/bash/pre-commit-format.sh`

Adaptations applied:
- **Renames for provenance**: every skill, agent, and hook was prefixed `rtk-` to make upstream provenance unambiguous. Components already prefixed (`rtk-triage`, `rtk-tdd`, `rtk-rewrite`, `rtk-suggest`, `rtk-testing-specialist`) kept their names. The upstream agent `rust-rtk` was renamed to `rtk-rust-expert` for prefix consistency. The upstream hook subdirectory script `bash/pre-commit-format.sh` was promoted to a top-level hook component named `rtk-pre-commit-format`.
- **Frontmatter**: rewrote upstream Anthropic-style skill spec (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`, `effort`, `tags`, `triggers`, `model`) into the wardrobe schema (`name`, `version`, `targets`, `type`, `category`, `license`). Hook frontmatter mapped to the wardrobe hook schema (`hooks:` block with event matchers + commands). Descriptions were rewritten into directive "Use when..." triggering form. All `category.primary` values are drawn from the wardrobe-validated set (workflow, backpressure, economy, etc.).
- **Cross-references**: internal references to upstream skill names (`/issue-triage`, `/pr-triage`, `/repo-recap`) were rewritten to their renamed equivalents (`/rtk-issue-triage`, `/rtk-pr-triage`, `/rtk-repo-recap`) inside `rtk-triage`, `rtk-issue-triage`, `rtk-pr-triage`, and `rtk-pr-review`. Template footers ("Triaged via … `/issue-triage`") were updated to the new names. The `code-reviewer` agent reference in `rtk-pr-triage` was left as-is — the wardrobe already provides an `agents/code-reviewer` component.
- **Hook scripts**: payload `.sh` files copied verbatim except for emoji removal in user-facing system messages (`⚡`, `🦀`, `🚀`, `✅`, `❌`) and the upstream "Generated with Claude Code" / "Co-Authored-By: Claude" trailers in template commit messages. No behavioural changes — `command -v rtk` graceful pass-through in `rtk-rewrite.sh` and the `rtk rewrite` exit-code protocol (0/1/2/3) are preserved intact.
- **Body content**: skill and agent bodies are largely as-published upstream, with light emoji stripping and AI-attribution trailers removed in keeping with wardrobe conventions. The full rtk-specific guidance (lazy_static regex, 60-90% token-savings assertions, fallback patterns, cross-platform shell escaping, security threat model) was preserved intact — it is the substance of the pack.

## JuliusBrussee/caveman

- **Source:** https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman
- **License:** MIT
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2026 Julius Brussee
- **Upstream commit:** `63a91ec`
- **Vendored skills (under `skills/`):**
  - `caveman/SKILL.md` — from `skills/caveman/SKILL.md`
  - `caveman-commit/SKILL.md` — from `skills/caveman-commit/SKILL.md`
  - `caveman-review/SKILL.md` — from `skills/caveman-review/SKILL.md`
  - `caveman-help/SKILL.md` — from `skills/caveman-help/SKILL.md`
  - `caveman-stats/SKILL.md` — from `skills/caveman-stats/SKILL.md`
  - `cavecrew/SKILL.md` — from `skills/cavecrew/SKILL.md`
  - `caveman-compress/SKILL.md` plus `caveman-compress/SECURITY.md` and `caveman-compress/scripts/*.py` (`__init__.py`, `__main__.py`, `benchmark.py`, `cli.py`, `compress.py`, `detect.py`, `validate.py`) — from `skills/caveman-compress/`

Naming: upstream skill names were already prefixed `caveman-` (with one bare `caveman` and the orchestrator skill `cavecrew`), and none collide with the existing `pocock-caveman` (different upstream — Matt Pocock's pack). Skills are vendored with their upstream names unchanged.

Adaptations applied:
- **Frontmatter**: rewrote the upstream Anthropic-style frontmatter (`name`, `description`) into the wardrobe schema (`name`, `version`, `targets`, `type`, `category`, `license`). Descriptions were rewritten into directive "Use when..." triggering form. All `category.primary` values are `economy` — these skills exist to cut token usage.
- **Body content**: largely as-published upstream. Light edits: removed emoji severity prefixes in `caveman-review` (replaced with bare `bug:` / `risk:` / `nit:` / `q:` so the skill works in emoji-free contexts) and used plain "Bad:" / "Good:" labels instead of red-X / green-check emoji on the examples; otherwise the caveman voice and rules are preserved intact.
- **AI-attribution policy**: the upstream `caveman-commit` skill already forbids "Generated with Claude Code" trailers in commit messages — that rule was preserved and generalised to "Any AI-attribution trailer". No upstream files contained Claude/Anthropic co-author trailers that needed stripping.
- **Subagent companions**: the `cavecrew` skill orchestrates three subagents (`cavecrew-investigator`, `cavecrew-builder`, `cavecrew-reviewer`) that live as agent components in the upstream `agents/` directory. Those agents were NOT vendored here — only the orchestrator skill. The skill body references the upstream source for callers who want the agent specs.
- **Supporting files**: the `caveman-compress` scripts are vendored verbatim. They call the Anthropic Python SDK (or fall back to the `claude` CLI) to do the actual compression — these are operational dependencies, not AI attribution, and remain as-is.
- **No-git scrub**: not applied to this pack. Caveman skills target Conventional Commits and PR review workflows, so git-specific language is part of the substance.
