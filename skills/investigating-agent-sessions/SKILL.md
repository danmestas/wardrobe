# Investigating Agent Sessions

## Overview

You have been asked to figure out what another agent (or your earlier
self) did in a different session. The session is over; only its
*artifacts* remain — transcripts on disk, files in the project, running
processes, log entries, dirty git state. Your job is to reconstruct
what happened from those artifacts well enough to debug, audit, or
continue the work.

**Core principle:** Past agents lie by accident. Their conclusions in
notes/PRs/commits may be wrong, falsified later, or written before
they had complete information. Verify every claim against current
evidence; never inherit a prior agent's root cause without re-deriving
it yourself.

## When to Use

- "Another session crashed / hit error X — figure out why."
- "What did the previous agent change / try / decide?"
- "I'm continuing work from yesterday's session — get me up to speed."
- "There's mystery state in this project (running process, orphan
  files, dirty index) — where did it come from?"
- Auditing an autonomous agent run after the fact.

**Don't use** for debugging your own *current* session — you have the
conversation context. This skill is for cold-reading sessions you were
not in.

## Quick Reference: Where to Look

Priority order. Stop early if the question is answered.

| Source | Path | What it tells you |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code session transcripts | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl` | Per-event JSONL: prompts, tool calls, tool results, errors. The most authoritative source for what an agent saw and did. |
| Project working tree | `<repo>/` | Current files, dirty git state, untracked artifacts (logs, lockfiles, scratch). |
| Tool-specific runtime state | `<repo>/.bones/`, `.orchestrator/`, `.fossil/`, `node_modules/.cache/`, etc. | Logs (`*.log`), pid files, sockets, sidecar DBs (SQLite `-wal`/`-shm`). |
| Project hooks | `<repo>/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json` | What fires on SessionStart/PreCompact/etc. — explains "where did this error come from?". |
| Running processes | `ps -o pid,etime,command` + `lsof -p <pid>` | Long-lived orphans, processes whose `cwd` or held files belong to the workspace, processes from prior sessions. |
| Trash | `~/.Trash/` (macOS), `~/.local/share/Trash/files/` (Linux) | Manually-deleted state that processes may still hold open. |
| Git history | `git log --oneline -30`, `git log -p -- <path>`, `git reflog` | What was done, when, by whom. Reflog catches branch checkouts/resets the log doesn't. |
| Tool source | the tool's repo | Pin the exact code path that produced an error message; don't guess from the error string. |
| Prior agent notes | scratch markdown, observation files, PR descriptions, ADRs | **Use as leads, not conclusions.** See "Critical reading" below. |

## Encoding the project path for `~/.claude/projects/`

Claude Code encodes the absolute working directory by replacing `/`
with `-` and prefixing with `-`:

```
/Users/dan/projects/serverdom  →  -Users-dan-projects-serverdom
```

```sh
ls "$HOME/.claude/projects/$(pwd | tr / -)"
```

Each `<uuid>.jsonl` is one session. Use `jq` (or `grep` for blunt
scans) — never read the whole file into your context window:

```sh
# Sessions in chronological order:
ls -lt ~/.claude/projects/-Users-dan-projects-serverdom/*.jsonl

# What tools the agent called:
jq -r 'select(.type=="assistant") | .message.content[]? | select(.type=="tool_use") | .name' \
  ~/.claude/projects/-Users-dan-projects-serverdom/<uuid>.jsonl | sort | uniq -c

# Errors the agent hit:
jq -r 'select(.type=="user") | .message.content[]? | select(.type=="tool_result" and .is_error==true) | .content' \
  ~/.claude/projects/-Users-dan-projects-serverdom/<uuid>.jsonl
```

## Critical reading of prior agent artifacts

If you find a prior agent's note (markdown observation, PR description,
ADR, scratch doc) **read it in full**, not just the introduction.

- Look for "falsified", "actually", "update:", "correction", "wrong",
  "scratch that", or new sections appended later.
- Check the file's `git log` / mtime to see whether the conclusion was
  amended after the original analysis.
- Treat hypotheses as leads to verify, not as answers. **A prior
  agent's wrong conclusion is worse than no prior context** — it
  steers you away from the true cause.

If you cannot independently re-derive the prior agent's conclusion
from current evidence, mark it `unverified` in your report and keep
investigating.

## Detecting orphan processes (high-value pattern)

`ps aux | grep` is not enough. Use `lsof` to find processes holding
files from the workspace — including files that no longer exist on
disk.

```sh
# Long-running tool processes:
ps -eo pid,etime,command | grep -E '<tool-name>' | sort -k2

# What does each process hold?
lsof -p <PID> | grep -E 'cwd|<workspace-path>|<state-dir>'

# Anything holding files in the workspace state dir, even unlinked?
lsof | grep '/path/to/workspace/<state-dir>'
```

Tells:

- `etime` ≫ session age → orphan from a prior session.
- `cwd` is the workspace but held files are in `~/.Trash/...` →
  orphan whose backing dir was moved/deleted out from under it.
- `lsof` reports a held inode that `ls` does not show in the
  directory → the file was unlinked but the FD is alive.

## Timeline reconstruction

When current disk state ≠ failure-window state, reconstruct order
from independent timestamps:

- `stat -f '%Sm %N' <path>` (macOS) / `stat -c '%y %n' <path>` (Linux)
  — file mtime.
- Log files — text timestamps (or, if absent, mtime of the log file
  bounds the last write).
- `ps -o pid,etime,lstart` — when each process started.
- `git log --since=<failure-time>` — commits since the failure.
- Claude Code transcripts — `cwd` field on the first event records
  the absolute time.

State current state vs. failure-window state explicitly in your
report. Do not conflate them.

### The user-visible error is often a downstream symptom

When a tool's log file (`hub.log`, `error.log`, etc.) and the user's
reported error disagree, **the log is usually closer to the root
cause**. The user only sees the *last* error before the process gave
up; the log captured the *first* error, which is what you actually
need to explain.

Cross-check: the timestamp of the user's reported failure should
follow, not precede, the upstream errors in the tool's log. If the
log's earlier error is plausibly a cause of the later user-visible
one, name the upstream error as the root cause and the user-visible
error as the downstream symptom.

## Capture environment versions

Different sessions, different tool versions:

```sh
which <tool>
<tool> --version
go list -m all 2>/dev/null | grep <relevant-dep>
sw_vers              # macOS
uname -a             # Linux
```

If multiple binaries of the same tool exist on PATH (e.g.
`/opt/homebrew/bin/<tool>` vs. `~/go/bin/<tool>`), an orphan from one
binary running alongside a fresh invocation of the other is a
plausible bug source.

## Cross-workspace correlation

A bug that surfaces in one workspace may have peers. Briefly survey
sibling workspaces:

```sh
ls ~/projects/                                  # or wherever
for d in ~/projects/*/.bones; do
  [ -d "$d" ] && ls -t "$d"/*.log 2>/dev/null | head -1
done
```

If the same artifact appears in unrelated projects, the bug is in the
tool, not the workspace.

## Read-only mindset

You are diagnosing, not fixing.

- Don't run mutating commands (`<tool> down`, `git reset`, `kill`,
  `rm`) without explicit user authorization for *this* investigation.
- Don't re-run the failing command "to see what happens" — it may
  damage the evidence (overwrite logs, change state). Investigate
  first, repro second, only if needed.
- If the workspace recovered between failure and now, **do not
  destroy the recovered state** to reproduce; capture findings
  against historical evidence first.

## Reporting

The user wants three things:

1. **What happened** (causal chain, not just symptom).
2. **Evidence** for each step in the chain — paths, line numbers,
   commands run, exact log lines.
3. **What's still uncertain** — assumptions you couldn't verify,
   reproductions you didn't attempt, prior-agent claims you couldn't
   re-derive.

Always include #3. Investigations without admitted gaps usually have
hidden ones.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Inheriting prior agent's conclusion without re-deriving it | Read their full note, check timestamps and amendments, verify each claim against current evidence. |
| `ps aux \| grep` and stopping there | Add `lsof -p <pid>` and `etime`. Most orphans are invisible in `ps` alone. |
| Treating current disk state as the failure-window state | Cross-check with mtimes, log timestamps, process etimes. Note divergence in the report. |
| Reading the whole session JSONL into context | Use `jq` filters or `grep` — pull only the events you need. |
| Forgetting to capture tool version + binary location | Run `which` + `--version`. Multiple binaries of the same name commonly explain "weird" behavior. |
| Skipping `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/` because the dir name looks like junk | The encoded path is intentional. It's where transcripts live. |
| "I'll just run `<tool> doctor` to see what it says" | Mutating. Diagnose first. |

## Red Flags — STOP and verify

- You're about to write a report whose root cause comes verbatim
  from a prior note, without your own re-derivation.
- You found one suspicious file/process and stopped looking.
- You can't say "I checked X, here's what it shows" for each item in
  the Quick Reference table you decided was relevant.
- Your timeline contradicts the user's report and you have not asked
  them about the discrepancy.
- You're tempted to run a mutating command "just to confirm".

All of these mean: stop, gather more evidence, re-read prior notes
critically, then write the report.
