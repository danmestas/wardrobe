# apm-builder

The repo-local build tool that compiles canonical `SKILL.md` components into
per-harness output under `dist/<target>/`. Each component is authored once,
validated against a shared schema, then emitted by adapters specific to each
harness (Claude Code, APM, Codex, Gemini, Copilot CLI, Pi).

## Commands

Run from the repo root:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run validate [-- --filter <glob>]` | Discover and validate components. Optional name glob. |
| `npm run build [-- --target <t>] [--filter <glob>]` | Emit per-target artifacts to `dist/`. `--target all` emits everything. |
| `npm run watch` | Initial build, then rebuild on changes (Claude Code target by default). |
| `npm run docs` | Regenerate the top-level `README.md` from component frontmatter. |
| `npx tsx apm-builder/cli.ts init <name> [--type <t>]` | Scaffold a new component directory with valid frontmatter. |

The `init` subcommand defaults to `--type skill`. Other valid types: `plugin`, `hook`, `agent`, `rules`, `mcp`. Names must be kebab-case lowercase. Scaffolds into `skills/`, `plugins/`, or `rules/` based on type.

## Component types

- **skill** — A reusable AI capability with a `SKILL.md` body.
- **plugin** — A bundle of skills (Claude Code / APM only). Lists referenced components in `includes:`.
- **hook** — A lifecycle event handler keyed by event (e.g., `Stop`, `PreToolUse`).
- **agent** — A specialized persona with optional `tools`, `model`, `color`.
- **rules** — Coding guidelines with optional `before`/`after` ordering.
- **mcp** — An MCP server registration with `command`, `args`, `env`.

Type/target compatibility is enforced by the matrix in `apm-builder/lib/validate.ts`. Errors include remediation hints listing valid alternatives.
