# Changelog

The `agent-config` repo is a multi-harness component monorepo without a
single canonical version tag at the repo root. Components are released
through the [`suit-build`](https://github.com/danmestas/suit) pipeline; sub-packages may carry their own tags
(e.g. `pikchr-generator@v0.2.0`).

This file tracks notable monorepo-level changes — adoption of new patterns,
harness adapter changes, taxonomy shifts. The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
