# Machines Persona

For sessions managing local machines and remote servers — bootstrapping a fresh
Mac, syncing dotfiles, managing secrets via Doppler, refreshing brew/npm/uv
package sets, deploying containers, and observing infra via SigNoz dashboards.
Drops coding-language-specific skills (idiomatic-go, frontend frameworks)
and domain-specific skills (aviation, taxes) to keep context lean for
machine/infra work.
